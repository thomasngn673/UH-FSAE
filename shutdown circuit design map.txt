Rules for IC Engine Master Switch
Master Switch: a switch that controls the action of relays or that makes and breaks the main supply line to a building or other installation
Primary Master Switch
Cockpit Master Switch
Actuating Master Switch must:
Stop the engine
Disable any alternator field wire 
Primary Master Switch
Disable power to ALL electrical circuits, including the battery, alternator, lights, fuel pump(s), ignition and electrical controls.
Be direct acting, not act through a relay or logic.
All battery current must flow through this switch
Be located on the right side of the vehicle, in proximity to the Main Hoop, at the driver's shoulder height
Be easily actuated from outside the vehicle
Be of the rotary mechanical type. A removable key may only be removable in the electrically open position
Be rigidly mounted to the vehicle and must not be removed during maintenance
Mounted so that the rotary axis of the key is near horizontal and across the vehicle
The ON position must be in the horizontal position and must be marked accordingly
The OFF position must be clearly marked
Cockpit Master Switch
Disable power to the ignition and fuel pump(s) and (ETC only) the electronic throttle in the OFF position
May act through a relay
Located in easy reach of the belted in driver, alongside the steering wheel, and unobstructed by the steering wheel or any other part of the vehicle
Must be a push-pull or push-rotate emergency switch where pushing the button is the OFF position
Have a minimum diameter of 24 mm

Major parts of the shutdown circuit:
Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD)
A standalone non programmable circuit must be used to monitor the electronic throttle control.
The BSPD must be provided in addition to the plausibility checks in the ETC which interpret the drivers throttle request and control the engine throttle position.
Signals from any sensors must be sent directly to the BSPD. Outputs from other modules may not be used in place of the raw sensor signals.
The BSPD must monitor for the following conditions:
Both of the following for more than one second:
Hard braking (for example >0.8 g deceleration but without locking the wheels)
Throttle greater than 10% open
Loss of signal from the braking sensor(s) for more than 100 msec 
Loss of signal from the throttle sensor(s) for more than 100 msec
Removal of power from the BSPD circuit
When any of the above conditions exist, the BSPD must:
Shut off power to the electronic throttle
Shut off fuel flow
Close the throttle to the idle position
The BSPD must only be reset by cycling the Primary Master Switch IC.8.4.3 OFF and ON
The BSPD must not reset when the Cockpit Master Switch IC.8.4.4 is turned OFF
The BSPD signals and function must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:
A separate set of detachable connectors for any signals from the braking sensor(s), throttle sensor(s) and removal of power to only the BSPD device.
An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of the brake sensor(s), throttle sensor(s) individually and power to only the BSPD device.
Inertia Switch
Cockpit Kill Switch
Brake Over-Travel Switch (BOTS)
A Brake Over Travel Switch (BOTS) must be installed such that brake pedal travel exceeding the normal range will actuate the switch
The BOTS must be a mechanical single pole, single throw (commonly known as a two position) switch (push-pull or flip type).
Operation of the BOTS to the OFF position must:
(IC) Shutdown the engine(s) and fuel pump(s) IC.8
(EV) Open the Shutdown Circuit EV.8.2.2
Repeated operation of the switch must not reset or restore power
The BOTS must be designed so that the driver cannot reset it.
The switch must be implemented with analog components, and not using programmable logic controllers, engine control units, or similar functioning digital controllers.
Tractive System Main Switch (TSMS)/Control System Main System (CSMS)
Insulation Monitoring Device (IMD)
Battery Management System (BMS)
Interlocks
